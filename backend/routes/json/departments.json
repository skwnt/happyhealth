    "details": "The X-Ray Department is a special place where doctors use amazing machines to take pictures of the inside of your body. These pictures help the doctors see your bones, muscles, and other important parts to figure out what’s making you feel unwell or if you’ve had an injury, like a broken bone. Don’t worry—it’s super quick and doesn’t hurt at all! You’ll stand still or lie down for a moment while the machine takes the picture, kind of like a big camera. It helps the doctors understand what’s happening so they can take the best care of you and help you feel better.",
